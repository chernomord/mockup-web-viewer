<h1 id="mockup-web-viewer">Mockup Web Viewer</h1>
<p>The main goal of this software is to provide myself and anyone else interested with the ability to present website graphic mockups to the client via url link. So at most cases it is supposed to male life of web designer little bit easier.</p>
<p>Pros (imho):</p>
<ul>
<li>your client gets slick preview for your work right in the window of his web browser.</li>
<li>you can edit content by adding your jpegs/png mockup files and modifying json text file. Javascript application will do the rest - populate main page with the list of links and create individual widescreen preview for each of your mockups.</li>
<li>you don&#39;t need to run any webserver software for this previewer to work.</li>
<li>you don&#39;t need to edit any code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modyfying .json file is still somewhat tedious task.</li>
</ul>
<p>AngularJS was used to do the most heavy lifting.</p>
